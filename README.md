I enjoyed working with Javiar. He communicated well and had no issues with respect and courtesy. He helped me when I had questions when I was the driver. He knows a lot about the code and does a good job coding. 

Unfortunately, there were times where we had a lot of issues with the software. We eventually got it figured out, but it took much longer than needed. Hopefully, we are done with the software problems and can just move on to the coding part of class. 
It was a joy to work in Javiar and hope we could be partners in the future.
