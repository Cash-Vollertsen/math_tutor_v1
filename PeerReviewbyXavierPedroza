I enjoyed collaborating with Cash, but I must admit that he may have carried a lot of weight of the project. Nothing bad; it's mostly on me (mostly due to the late setup of Clion). I have no suggestions for improvement;
everything he did was excellent: coding, troubleshooting, resolving issues (even if we both did not know what to do), knowing what part he should work on (even if I struggled to figure what
part I should work on at times due to my setbacks), and he occasionally asked me for help on some things (which helps with communication between us).
